"""
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive. 
The program prompts the user to enter a number continuously until the number matches 
the randomly generated number. For each user input, the program tells the user whether
the input is too low or too high, so the user can choose the next input intelligently.

# Test the guess and output a message accordingly
